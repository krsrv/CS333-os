1. The address of *kmem.freelist* is the head of the free list, i.e., the list that stores the list of free memory. Line 3176 creates a temporary *struct run* variable, whose address is the same as *v*. The next line links this temporary variable such that the next *struct run* variable is the head of the current *kmem.freelist*. Line 3178 sets kmem.freelist to this temporary variable, effectively adding the newly freed memory to the beginning of the free list.

2. Line 1740: PDX(va) extracts the first 10 bits of va, which gives the page directory index. pgdir[PDX(va)] takes the corresponding entry from the page directory entry pgdir. Finally, we store its address in pde to match the datatype of pde.
  Line 1742: if pde is present (line 1741), the page table, pgtab is set to the address of the page table entry given by P2V(PTE_ADDR(*pde)). PTE_ADDR is a macro which extracts the first 20 bits of its arguments. P2V offsets the argument address by KERNBASE, so that we get an address in the user space. This statement therefore, sets pgtab as an array of page table entries.
  Line 1753: PTX extracts the page table entry information from the argument. pgtab[PTX(va)] gets the the corresponding page table entry from the pgtab array.
